# Notes

Append-only log of real facts discovered while building this tool — CLI flags, schema quirks,
addon format details, anything surprising. Newest at bottom.

## 2026-08-22 — Stage 1 pre-flight research

- `wowsims/tbc-new` confirmed to exist on GitHub, fork of `wowsims/mop`, latest release
  v0.0.116 (2026-08-14). `cmd/wowsimcli` builds via `go build --tags=with_db`.
- `docs/commands.md` in tbc-new documents only `make` targets (`make host`, `make db`,
  `make wowsimtbc`, `make test`, etc.) — it does NOT document `wowsimcli`'s actual runtime
  flags. Those have to come from `wowsimcli --help` after building, per the spec's instruction.
- Makefile CLI build (Windows): `cd ./cmd/wowsimcli && GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 GOAMD64=v2 go
  build -o wowsimcli-windows.exe --tags=with_db -ldflags="-X 'main.Version=$(VERSION)' -s -w"`.
  No npm/vite step for the CLI — that's only in `make host`/`make wowsimtbc` (web UI).
- Local toolchain at start of Stage 1: Go — NOT installed. Node/npm — NOT installed. Python
  3.13.7 — installed. git 2.55.0 — installed.
- Installed addon: `WowSimsExporter` v3.2.4 (TOC), well past the v2.8 that added
  SavedVariables auto-save. `## SavedVariables: WSEDB` in the TOC — global var name is `WSEDB`,
  on-disk file is `WowSimsExporter.lua` under some `WTF/Account/<ACCOUNT>/SavedVariables/`.
  `autoSaveEnabled = true` by default (AceDB profile default in `SavedDataManager.lua`).
- `SavedDataManager:OnCharacterChanged` only fires an auto-save when
  `character.level == GetMaxPlayerLevel()` (`WowSimsExporter.lua` / `SavedDataManager.lua`).
  Below cap, nothing auto-saves — a manual `/wse export` is needed to seed the SavedVariables.
- `WTF/Account/` on this machine has 4 candidate dirs: `119781733#1`, `430010907#1`,
  `ELFIDELFI`, `PULLANDGO`, plus a stray top-level `SavedVariables` folder. Which one is the
  Nightelf SV Hunter's account is unresolved — first concrete ingestion task.
- Read `ExportStructures/EquipmentSpec.lua` directly: `FillFromBagItems()` iterates
  `bagId = 0, NUM_BAG_SLOTS` only. **No bank container is read.** This is confirmed from
  source, not inferred — a companion bank-export addon is required, the spec's assumption was
  correct.
- Export schema (`Character.lua`): default export (`GenerateOutput`) is
  `{version, unit, id, name, realm, race, class, level, talents, professions, spec, gear,
  glyphs}`, JSON-encoded via `LibParse:JSONEncode`. `gear.items` here is **equipped only**
  (`UpdateEquippedItems`). Bag contents come from a separate generator (`GenerateOutputBags`)
  producing a bare `{items: [...]}` — equipped and bag exports are two different button
  actions/outputs in the addon UI, not one combined export. Tool must call/merge both.
- `EquipmentSpec.items` is a 17-slot fixed array (`itemLayout` in `EquipmentSpec.lua`): head,
  neck, shoulder, back, chest, wrist, hand, waist, legs, feet, finger1, finger2, trinket1,
  trinket2, mainhand, offhand, ranged. Ammo is explicitly excluded ("Not supported as item").
- Phase 3 launches 2026-08-27 (5 days out from today). DB-coverage check for P3 items is
  expected to possibly show gaps/placeholders right now — not a bug if so.

## 2026-08-22 — Go install, submodule pin

- Installed Go 1.26.7 via `winget install --id GoLang.Go`. Installer puts it at
  `C:\Program Files\Go\bin` and updates the machine PATH — new shells pick it up automatically,
  but the git-bash tool session already open in this conversation did not; had to prepend
  `/c/Program Files/Go/bin` to PATH manually in that session.
- `wowsims/tbc-new` added as git submodule at `sim/tbc-new`, pinned commit
  `3267f8dfa4a20746d4982c1522fdec1d4eb77f4c` (2026-08-19, "Add selected potion/conjured APL
  check"). This is the SHA to report in every sim output per the ground rules.
